Task 2: Controlling Annotation Job/Task Suppose, you have been assigned a dataset that consists of 100,000 images on 02 February, 2024. The dataset has 3 different classes Bounding Box, Polygon and Keypoint with individual annotation benchmarks 10, 15 and 5 seconds and Quality Check benchmarking 5, 7 and 3 seconds. Every single image has 1 object of each class on average. Also, the estimated total effective working hours of an annotator is 6 hours a day. Now, how would you identify the following things,
1.	The total effective working hour to finish the task including and excluding the Quality Check
2.	The total number of annotators required to accomplish the task in 10 days
3.	Identify the estimated date to deliver the project to the client if you have got extra 5 annotators from HR (exclude off-days).
